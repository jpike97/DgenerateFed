I think there's a big difference between asking shit like "What kinda plays are we making tomorrow? I'm thinking about buying the MSFT dip" and being like "LOL PUMP $DICC to 420.69!" "$DICC, 69.420 04/20!" "$DICC PUMP GET IN NOWWWW"

My moves tomorrow:

Wake up hungover. Watch my MSFT calls burn as I shower. Watch SQ burn up a little bit. Watch this stupid Ally thing rise up. Get to work. Then "work." Add a little more money into RH and spend it on some stupid shit that someone who's about to get banned pumps. maybe hopefully lose only 15% on the day.

Get home. Drink a lot more.

Got annihilated buying calls at the top of MSFT’s last run up. Sold at a hefty loss after the JEDI ruling. Everyone here has gone quiet on MSFT lately. Whenever that happens things seem to take off again after the initial cull. Bought back in today; 3APR $182.5C. Anyone with me?

Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

Putting these out there for good karma and maybe some advice or things I should consider.

EDIT: Anyone else looking at $INTC 70c 3/20??? These are <$1 right now.

Hello it's me, a derivative selling computer algorithm. I sold thousands of deep OTM $SPCE calls 3 months ago. Thanks to a high short interest and low float coupled with media coverage, the underlying has risen enough that my risk management function is yelling at me to hedge. Guess I'll buy $SPCE in bulk at market value every dip.

Hello it's me, a derivative selling computer algorithm. I sold thousands of deep OTM $SPCE calls 3 months ago. Thanks to a high short interest and low float coupled with media coverage, the underlying has risen enough that my risk management function is yelling at me to hedge. Guess I'll buy $SPCE in bulk at market value every dip.

**Magical Crayons TA.**

Yesterday during the session [I suggested getting puts to hedge for today.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f69d94/daily_discussion_thread_february_19_2020/fi3xodp/) I didn't expect as large a drop as we had, which broke the [first support given in yesterday's post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6hd6q/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_20_2020/fi4ueqz/) As [I posted last week when we were wondering if there would be a Friday sell-off,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3guwk/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_14/fhisg20/) breaking of the first support at 335.3 led to selling to 334.7 and a reversal there.

Throughout the day I posted that another small put hedge is a good idea for tomorrow because of the first bit of economic news of the week finally coming up, and G20 this weekend which may cause more risk averse traders to sell off some. We don't have a true bear flag, but if it "completes," the drop is expect to be to 333.2ish, though a small gap to about 332.8 still needs to be filled so it could reach something as low as that. Those ranges represent the next support. If the economic news is good and you're a bull, it is most ideal to exceed the price point of a drop-- around 338.5. To see if we're in another mini-correction we would need to see another "lower high" being set, so exceeding 337.8ish would be the beginnings of a positive sign.

Futures are right on the cusp of breaking our current bullish price channel back into the lower one we had during the coronavirus announcement, so if you're a bull you hope that the pajama traders start buying.

Good luck to all tomorrow and get those tendies.

Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from

No doubt in my mind that a huge chunk of this LL move was driven by the post here.  It would've started to move regardless given pre-earnings positioning, but that was like pouring jet fuel onto a small fire.  Options IV just started ramping up as that WSB post got noticed (and now spread everywhere through marketwatch).

Add a little more money into RH and spend it on some stupid shit that someone who's about to get banned pumps. maybe hopefully lose only 15% on the day.

Get home. Drink a lot more.

Such a massive amount of cognitive dissonance in this market & on this sub. China GDP for first quarter is about to go from 6.1 to -.2% and Nasdaq keeps mooning. 


Apple report sales in China down up to fucking 60% this quarter, but gets bought up so hard today lmao. 

Hedge funds too pussy to sell, they have been underperforming the S&P for a while. but when it starts to crack, they’re all going to bail. Might not be tomorrow, or even next week, but there is no way stocks are pricing in any sort of risk and tbh it’s fucking retarded. 

Mean reversion will come, like it always has, and it will be much more painful this time. 

Except QQQ to reach at least 226, and will buy puts tomorrow depending on the price action.

Such a massive amount of cognitive dissonance in this market & on this sub. China GDP for first quarter is about to go from 6.1 to -.2% and Nasdaq keeps mooning.

**Magical Crayons TA.**

Yesterday during the session [I suggested getting puts to hedge for today.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f69d94/daily_discussion_thread_february_19_2020/fi3xodp/) I didn't expect as large a drop as we had, which broke the [first support given in yesterday's post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6hd6q/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_20_2020/fi4ueqz/) As [I posted last week when we were wondering if there would be a Friday sell-off,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3guwk/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_14/fhisg20/) breaking of the first support at 335.3 led to selling to 334.7 and a reversal there.

Throughout the day I posted that another small put hedge is a good idea for tomorrow because of the first bit of economic news of the week finally coming up, and G20 this weekend which may cause more risk averse traders to sell off some. We don't have a true bear flag, but if it "completes," the drop is expect to be to 333.2ish, though a small gap to about 332.8 still needs to be filled so it could reach something as low as that. Those ranges represent the next support. If the economic news is good and you're a bull, it is most ideal to exceed the price point of a drop-- around 338.5. To see if we're in another mini-correction we would need to see another "lower high" being set, so exceeding 337.8ish would be the beginnings of a positive sign.

Futures are right on the cusp of breaking our current bullish price channel back into the lower one we had during the coronavirus announcement, so if you're a bull you hope that the pajama traders start buying.

Good luck to all tomorrow and get those tendies.

Like usually it will be a news headline and a 1 candle algo move. Like when all the trade talk shit was going on. But a real sell straight down...

Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

Putting these out there for good karma and maybe some advice or things I should consider.

EDIT: Anyone else looking at $INTC 70c 3/20??? These are <$1 right now.

Lmao First Solar (FSLR) is absolutely fucked tomorrrow. EPS of -0.56 compared to estimate of 2.76. They missed sales by $1.4 billion.

1.4 billion dollars. Fucking hell. Puts at open?

Edit: Sales were 1.4 billion on estimate of 1.79 billion. I’m retarded and can’t read. You’re still fucked if you have calls tho.

To do tomorrow:
Watch my $FSLR calls go to .05. 
Wonder why I didn't sell at noon Thursday. Remember that it's because I have a 9-5 that I hate.
Watch everything else turn red and realize I don't have a healthy mix of puts because autism.
Maybe find some money to buy some way otm calls so I have some hope for next week.

Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.

2020-02-20 10:37:11.088236between words
ETFC just got bought by Morgan Stanley for $13B. They're up 23% premarket. 

PRO-TIP: DO NOT BUY ETFC!!

I've seen it far too many times that people see companies up big % and they try to jump in and ride the wave or try to short expecting a pull-back. Do not do this here. 

When a company gets purchased, the share price rises to the value of the buyout. It will not go above the buyout value and it will not drop below buyout value either. Once the deal is announced, it's done for the company being purchased. 

I know this sounds obvious to most, but I've seen it happen one to many times. 

The only play in this deal, if you wanted one, is to play Morgan Stanley.

When a company gets purchased, the share price rises to the value of the buyout. It will not go above the buyout value and it will not drop below buyout value either. Once the deal is announced, it's done for the company being purchased. 

I know this sounds obvious to most, but I've seen it happen one to many times. 

The only play in this deal, if you wanted one, is to play Morgan Stanley.

Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

Putting these out there for good karma and maybe some advice or things I should consider.

I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

Putting these out there for good karma and maybe some advice or things I should consider.

EDIT: Anyone else looking at $INTC 70c 3/20??? These are <$1 right now.

**Magical Crayons TA.**

Yesterday during the session [I suggested getting puts to hedge for today.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f69d94/daily_discussion_thread_february_19_2020/fi3xodp/) I didn't expect as large a drop as we had, which broke the [first support given in yesterday's post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6hd6q/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_20_2020/fi4ueqz/) As [I posted last week when we were wondering if there would be a Friday sell-off,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3guwk/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_14/fhisg20/) breaking of the first support at 335.3 led to selling to 334.7 and a reversal there.

Throughout the day I posted that another small put hedge is a good idea for tomorrow because of the first bit of economic news of the week finally coming up, and G20 this weekend which may cause more risk averse traders to sell off some. We don't have a true bear flag, but if it "completes," the drop is expect to be to 333.2ish, though a small gap to about 332.8 still needs to be filled so it could reach something as low as that. Those ranges represent the next support. If the economic news is good and you're a bull, it is most ideal to exceed the price point of a drop-- around 338.5. To see if we're in another mini-correction we would need to see another "lower high" being set, so exceeding 337.8ish would be the beginnings of a positive sign.

Futures are right on the cusp of breaking our current bullish price channel back into the lower one we had during the coronavirus announcement, so if you're a bull you hope that the pajama traders start buying.

Good luck to all tomorrow and get those tendies.

between words
Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

Putting these out there for good karma and maybe some advice or things I should consider.

My moves tomorrow:

Wake up hungover. Watch my MSFT calls burn as I shower. Watch SQ burn up a little bit. Watch this stupid Ally thing rise up. Get to work. Then "work." Add a little more money into RH and spend it on some stupid shit that someone who's about to get banned pumps. maybe hopefully lose only 15% on the day.

Get home. Drink a lot more.

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

Putting these out there for good karma and maybe some advice or things I should consider.

My moves tomorrow:

Wake up hungover. Watch my MSFT calls burn as I shower. Watch SQ burn up a little bit. Watch this stupid Ally thing rise up. Get to work. Then "work." Add a little more money into RH and spend it on some stupid shit that someone who's about to get banned pumps. maybe hopefully lose only 15% on the day.

Get home. Drink a lot more.

**Magical Crayons TA.**

Yesterday during the session [I suggested getting puts to hedge for today.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f69d94/daily_discussion_thread_february_19_2020/fi3xodp/) I didn't expect as large a drop as we had, which broke the [first support given in yesterday's post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6hd6q/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_20_2020/fi4ueqz/) As [I posted last week when we were wondering if there would be a Friday sell-off,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3guwk/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_14/fhisg20/) breaking of the first support at 335.3 led to selling to 334.7 and a reversal there.

Throughout the day I posted that another small put hedge is a good idea for tomorrow because of the first bit of economic news of the week finally coming up, and G20 this weekend which may cause more risk averse traders to sell off some. We don't have a true bear flag, but if it "completes," the drop is expect to be to 333.2ish, though a small gap to about 332.8 still needs to be filled so it could reach something as low as that. Those ranges represent the next support. If the economic news is good and you're a bull, it is most ideal to exceed the price point of a drop-- around 338.5. To see if we're in another mini-correction we would need to see another "lower high" being set, so exceeding 337.8ish would be the beginnings of a positive sign.

Futures are right on the cusp of breaking our current bullish price channel back into the lower one we had during the coronavirus announcement, so if you're a bull you hope that the pajama traders start buying.

Good luck to all tomorrow and get those tendies.

Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.

Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

Putting these out there for good karma and maybe some advice or things I should consider.

EDIT: Anyone else looking at $INTC 70c 3/20??? These are <$1 right now.

Please join me as we recite The Autist's Prayer.

Our u/1R0NYMAN who art in debt, hallowed be thy name. Thy box spreads come. Thy will be done, on Robinhood as it is in r/wallstreetbets. Give us this day our risk-free money; and forgive us our puts against you, as we forgive those who exercise their options early; and lead us not into r/personalfinance, but deliver us some tendies.

EDIT: Can't take the credit, had this saved from u/DrTendies but felt like the $SPCE rush was a good opportunity to bring it back out.

Bezos was the kid who licked all the cookies on a tray so no one else could eat them.

What a waste of time and investors' profits. Nothing will change next week.

The JEDI deal is gonna go through the day after my MSFT calls expire.

Got annihilated buying calls at the top of MSFT’s last run up. Sold at a hefty loss after the JEDI ruling. Everyone here has gone quiet on MSFT lately. Whenever that happens things seem to take off again after the initial cull. Bought back in today; 3APR $182.5C. Anyone with me?

2020-02-20 11:25:06.487649between words
ETFC just got bought by Morgan Stanley for $13B. They're up 23% premarket. 

PRO-TIP: DO NOT BUY ETFC!!

I've seen it far too many times that people see companies up big % and they try to jump in and ride the wave or try to short expecting a pull-back. Do not do this here. 

When a company gets purchased, the share price rises to the value of the buyout. It will not go above the buyout value and it will not drop below buyout value either. Once the deal is announced, it's done for the company being purchased. 

I know this sounds obvious to most, but I've seen it happen one to many times. 

The only play in this deal, if you wanted one, is to play Morgan Stanley.

Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

Putting these out there for good karma and maybe some advice or things I should consider.

Hello it's me, a derivative selling computer algorithm. I sold thousands of deep OTM $SPCE calls 3 months ago. Thanks to a high short interest and low float coupled with media coverage, the underlying has risen enough that my risk management function is yelling at me to hedge. Guess I'll buy $SPCE in bulk at market value every dip.

TLDR - financial times implying WSB has coordinated the pumping of SPCE and is it considered market manipulation 

lol, these fuckers are seriously overestimating this subreddit

Told my dad to invest in SPCE a couple of weeks ago. He bought 19 contacts expiring in January 2021 or 2022 with a strike price of $18... needless to say he’s pretty happy I told him

Hello it's me, a derivative selling computer algorithm. I sold thousands of deep OTM $SPCE calls 3 months ago. Thanks to a high short interest and low float coupled with media coverage, the underlying has risen enough that my risk management function is yelling at me to hedge. Guess I'll buy $SPCE in bulk at market value every dip.

**Magical Crayons TA.**

Yesterday during the session [I suggested getting puts to hedge for today.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f69d94/daily_discussion_thread_february_19_2020/fi3xodp/) I didn't expect as large a drop as we had, which broke the [first support given in yesterday's post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6hd6q/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_20_2020/fi4ueqz/) As [I posted last week when we were wondering if there would be a Friday sell-off,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3guwk/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_14/fhisg20/) breaking of the first support at 335.3 led to selling to 334.7 and a reversal there.

Throughout the day I posted that another small put hedge is a good idea for tomorrow because of the first bit of economic news of the week finally coming up, and G20 this weekend which may cause more risk averse traders to sell off some. We don't have a true bear flag, but if it "completes," the drop is expect to be to 333.2ish, though a small gap to about 332.8 still needs to be filled so it could reach something as low as that. Those ranges represent the next support. If the economic news is good and you're a bull, it is most ideal to exceed the price point of a drop-- around 338.5. To see if we're in another mini-correction we would need to see another "lower high" being set, so exceeding 337.8ish would be the beginnings of a positive sign.

Futures are right on the cusp of breaking our current bullish price channel back into the lower one we had during the coronavirus announcement, so if you're a bull you hope that the pajama traders start buying.

Good luck to all tomorrow and get those tendies.

Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

Putting these out there for good karma and maybe some advice or things I should consider.

So who's with me for SQ calls, for the earnings report on Wed?
between words
Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

Putting these out there for good karma and maybe some advice or things I should consider.

EDIT: Anyone else looking at $INTC 70c 3/20??? These are <$1 right now.

My moves tomorrow:

Wake up hungover. Watch my MSFT calls burn as I shower. Watch SQ burn up a little bit. Watch this stupid Ally thing rise up. Get to work. Then "work." Add a little more money into RH and spend it on some stupid shit that someone who's about to get banned pumps. maybe hopefully lose only 15% on the day.

Get home. Drink a lot more.

**Magical Crayons TA.**

Yesterday during the session [I suggested getting puts to hedge for today.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f69d94/daily_discussion_thread_february_19_2020/fi3xodp/) I didn't expect as large a drop as we had, which broke the [first support given in yesterday's post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6hd6q/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_20_2020/fi4ueqz/) As [I posted last week when we were wondering if there would be a Friday sell-off,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3guwk/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_14/fhisg20/) breaking of the first support at 335.3 led to selling to 334.7 and a reversal there.

Throughout the day I posted that another small put hedge is a good idea for tomorrow because of the first bit of economic news of the week finally coming up, and G20 this weekend which may cause more risk averse traders to sell off some. We don't have a true bear flag, but if it "completes," the drop is expect to be to 333.2ish, though a small gap to about 332.8 still needs to be filled so it could reach something as low as that. Those ranges represent the next support. If the economic news is good and you're a bull, it is most ideal to exceed the price point of a drop-- around 338.5. To see if we're in another mini-correction we would need to see another "lower high" being set, so exceeding 337.8ish would be the beginnings of a positive sign.

Futures are right on the cusp of breaking our current bullish price channel back into the lower one we had during the coronavirus announcement, so if you're a bull you hope that the pajama traders start buying.

Good luck to all tomorrow and get those tendies.

Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

Putting these out there for good karma and maybe some advice or things I should consider.

EDIT: Anyone else looking at $INTC 70c 3/20??? These are <$1 right now.

Lmao First Solar (FSLR) is absolutely fucked tomorrrow. EPS of -0.56 compared to estimate of 2.76. They missed sales by $1.4 billion.

1.4 billion dollars. Fucking hell. Puts at open?

Edit: Sales were 1.4 billion on estimate of 1.79 billion. I’m retarded and can’t read. You’re still fucked if you have calls tho.

To do tomorrow:
Watch my $FSLR calls go to .05. 
Wonder why I didn't sell at noon Thursday. Remember that it's because I have a 9-5 that I hate.
Watch everything else turn red and realize I don't have a healthy mix of puts because autism.
Maybe find some money to buy some way otm calls so I have some hope for next week.

Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from

Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

Putting these out there for good karma and maybe some advice or things I should consider.

EDIT: Anyone else looking at $INTC 70c 3/20??? These are <$1 right now.

Got annihilated buying calls at the top of MSFT’s last run up. Sold at a hefty loss after the JEDI ruling. Everyone here has gone quiet on MSFT lately. Whenever that happens things seem to take off again after the initial cull. Bought back in today; 3APR $182.5C. Anyone with me?

2020-02-20 11:30:05.069084between words
ETFC just got bought by Morgan Stanley for $13B. They're up 23% premarket. 

PRO-TIP: DO NOT BUY ETFC!!

I've seen it far too many times that people see companies up big % and they try to jump in and ride the wave or try to short expecting a pull-back. Do not do this here. 

When a company gets purchased, the share price rises to the value of the buyout. It will not go above the buyout value and it will not drop below buyout value either. Once the deal is announced, it's done for the company being purchased. 

I know this sounds obvious to most, but I've seen it happen one to many times. 

The only play in this deal, if you wanted one, is to play Morgan Stanley.

This market is nuts. I feel like I'm just watching trains ZOOM by. You gotta be smart to grab early and get in and then HOP off at the right time too. 

STMPS zoomed by me. Just going to wave and wait for the next one. Don't try to FOMO into something you don't understand boys. Options are fucking nuts on STMPS right now.

Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

Putting these out there for good karma and maybe some advice or things I should consider.

Hello it's me, a derivative selling computer algorithm. I sold thousands of deep OTM $SPCE calls 3 months ago. Thanks to a high short interest and low float coupled with media coverage, the underlying has risen enough that my risk management function is yelling at me to hedge. Guess I'll buy $SPCE in bulk at market value every dip.

Thanks to a high short interest and low float coupled with media coverage, the underlying has risen enough that my risk management function is yelling at me to hedge.

**Magical Crayons TA.**

Yesterday during the session [I suggested getting puts to hedge for today.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f69d94/daily_discussion_thread_february_19_2020/fi3xodp/) I didn't expect as large a drop as we had, which broke the [first support given in yesterday's post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6hd6q/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_20_2020/fi4ueqz/) As [I posted last week when we were wondering if there would be a Friday sell-off,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3guwk/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_14/fhisg20/) breaking of the first support at 335.3 led to selling to 334.7 and a reversal there.

Throughout the day I posted that another small put hedge is a good idea for tomorrow because of the first bit of economic news of the week finally coming up, and G20 this weekend which may cause more risk averse traders to sell off some. We don't have a true bear flag, but if it "completes," the drop is expect to be to 333.2ish, though a small gap to about 332.8 still needs to be filled so it could reach something as low as that. Those ranges represent the next support. If the economic news is good and you're a bull, it is most ideal to exceed the price point of a drop-- around 338.5. To see if we're in another mini-correction we would need to see another "lower high" being set, so exceeding 337.8ish would be the beginnings of a positive sign.

Futures are right on the cusp of breaking our current bullish price channel back into the lower one we had during the coronavirus announcement, so if you're a bull you hope that the pajama traders start buying.

Good luck to all tomorrow and get those tendies.

We don't have a true bear flag, but if it "completes," the drop is expect to be to 333.2ish, though a small gap to about 332.8 still needs to be filled so it could reach something as low as that. Those ranges represent the next support. If the economic news is good and you're a bull, it is most ideal to exceed the price point of a drop-- around 338.5. To see if we're in another mini-correction we would need to see another "lower high" being set, so exceeding 337.8ish would be the beginnings of a positive sign.

Futures are right on the cusp of breaking our current bullish price channel back into the lower one we had during the coronavirus announcement, so if you're a bull you hope that the pajama traders start buying.

Good luck to all tomorrow and get those tendies.

Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

Putting these out there for good karma and maybe some advice or things I should consider.

Wake up hungover. Watch my MSFT calls burn as I shower. Watch SQ burn up a little bit. Watch this stupid Ally thing rise up. Get to work. Then "work." Add a little more money into RH and spend it on some stupid shit that someone who's about to get banned pumps. maybe hopefully lose only 15% on the day.

Get home. Drink a lot more.

Apple report sales in China down up to fucking 60% this quarter, but gets bought up so hard today lmao. 

Hedge funds too pussy to sell, they have been underperforming the S&P for a while. but when it starts to crack, they’re all going to bail. Might not be tomorrow, or even next week, but there is no way stocks are pricing in any sort of risk and tbh it’s fucking retarded. 

Mean reversion will come, like it always has, and it will be much more painful this time. 

Except QQQ to reach at least 226, and will buy puts tomorrow depending on the price action.

**Magical Crayons TA.**

Yesterday during the session [I suggested getting puts to hedge for today.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f69d94/daily_discussion_thread_february_19_2020/fi3xodp/) I didn't expect as large a drop as we had, which broke the [first support given in yesterday's post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6hd6q/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_20_2020/fi4ueqz/) As [I posted last week when we were wondering if there would be a Friday sell-off,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3guwk/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_14/fhisg20/) breaking of the first support at 335.3 led to selling to 334.7 and a reversal there.

Throughout the day I posted that another small put hedge is a good idea for tomorrow because of the first bit of economic news of the week finally coming up, and G20 this weekend which may cause more risk averse traders to sell off some. We don't have a true bear flag, but if it "completes," the drop is expect to be to 333.2ish, though a small gap to about 332.8 still needs to be filled so it could reach something as low as that. Those ranges represent the next support. If the economic news is good and you're a bull, it is most ideal to exceed the price point of a drop-- around 338.5. To see if we're in another mini-correction we would need to see another "lower high" being set, so exceeding 337.8ish would be the beginnings of a positive sign.

Futures are right on the cusp of breaking our current bullish price channel back into the lower one we had during the coronavirus announcement, so if you're a bull you hope that the pajama traders start buying.

Good luck to all tomorrow and get those tendies.

Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

Putting these out there for good karma and maybe some advice or things I should consider.

EDIT: Anyone else looking at $INTC 70c 3/20??? These are <$1 right now.

Got annihilated buying calls at the top of MSFT’s last run up. Sold at a hefty loss after the JEDI ruling. Everyone here has gone quiet on MSFT lately. Whenever that happens things seem to take off again after the initial cull. Bought back in today; 3APR $182.5C. Anyone with me?

Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

Putting these out there for good karma and maybe some advice or things I should consider.

EDIT: Anyone else looking at $INTC 70c 3/20??? These are <$1 right now.

well, -25K at the low today, closed at -8.3K

SPCE 2/21 37C and SPCE 2/28 45C - holding about 3K in these
TSLA 2/28 1100C... 15x or 9.2K

**Magical Crayons TA.**

Yesterday during the session [I suggested getting puts to hedge for today.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f69d94/daily_discussion_thread_february_19_2020/fi3xodp/) I didn't expect as large a drop as we had, which broke the [first support given in yesterday's post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6hd6q/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_20_2020/fi4ueqz/) As [I posted last week when we were wondering if there would be a Friday sell-off,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3guwk/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_14/fhisg20/) breaking of the first support at 335.3 led to selling to 334.7 and a reversal there.

Throughout the day I posted that another small put hedge is a good idea for tomorrow because of the first bit of economic news of the week finally coming up, and G20 this weekend which may cause more risk averse traders to sell off some. We don't have a true bear flag, but if it "completes," the drop is expect to be to 333.2ish, though a small gap to about 332.8 still needs to be filled so it could reach something as low as that. Those ranges represent the next support. If the economic news is good and you're a bull, it is most ideal to exceed the price point of a drop-- around 338.5. To see if we're in another mini-correction we would need to see another "lower high" being set, so exceeding 337.8ish would be the beginnings of a positive sign.

Futures are right on the cusp of breaking our current bullish price channel back into the lower one we had during the coronavirus announcement, so if you're a bull you hope that the pajama traders start buying.

Good luck to all tomorrow and get those tendies.

Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

Putting these out there for good karma and maybe some advice or things I should consider.

Wake up hungover. Watch my MSFT calls burn as I shower. Watch SQ burn up a little bit. Watch this stupid Ally thing rise up. Get to work. Then "work." Add a little more money into RH and spend it on some stupid shit that someone who's about to get banned pumps. maybe hopefully lose only 15% on the day.

Get home. Drink a lot more.

**Magical Crayons TA.**

Yesterday during the session [I suggested getting puts to hedge for today.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f69d94/daily_discussion_thread_february_19_2020/fi3xodp/) I didn't expect as large a drop as we had, which broke the [first support given in yesterday's post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6hd6q/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_20_2020/fi4ueqz/) As [I posted last week when we were wondering if there would be a Friday sell-off,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3guwk/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_14/fhisg20/) breaking of the first support at 335.3 led to selling to 334.7 and a reversal there.

Throughout the day I posted that another small put hedge is a good idea for tomorrow because of the first bit of economic news of the week finally coming up, and G20 this weekend which may cause more risk averse traders to sell off some. We don't have a true bear flag, but if it "completes," the drop is expect to be to 333.2ish, though a small gap to about 332.8 still needs to be filled so it could reach something as low as that. Those ranges represent the next support. If the economic news is good and you're a bull, it is most ideal to exceed the price point of a drop-- around 338.5. To see if we're in another mini-correction we would need to see another "lower high" being set, so exceeding 337.8ish would be the beginnings of a positive sign.

Futures are right on the cusp of breaking our current bullish price channel back into the lower one we had during the coronavirus announcement, so if you're a bull you hope that the pajama traders start buying.

Good luck to all tomorrow and get those tendies.

Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss.

Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

Lmao First Solar (FSLR) is absolutely fucked tomorrrow. EPS of -0.56 compared to estimate of 2.76. They missed sales by $1.4 billion.

1.4 billion dollars. Fucking hell. Puts at open?

Edit: Sales were 1.4 billion on estimate of 1.79 billion. I’m retarded and can’t read. You’re still fucked if you have calls tho.

To do tomorrow:
Watch my $FSLR calls go to .05. 
Wonder why I didn't sell at noon Thursday. Remember that it's because I have a 9-5 that I hate.
Watch everything else turn red and realize I don't have a healthy mix of puts because autism.
Maybe find some money to buy some way otm calls so I have some hope for next week.
Drink heavily.

Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

Putting these out there for good karma and maybe some advice or things I should consider.

Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from

2020-02-20 13:39:51.785611between words
ETFC just got bought by Morgan Stanley for $13B. They're up 23% premarket. 

PRO-TIP: DO NOT BUY ETFC!!

I've seen it far too many times that people see companies up big % and they try to jump in and ride the wave or try to short expecting a pull-back. Do not do this here. 

When a company gets purchased, the share price rises to the value of the buyout. It will not go above the buyout value and it will not drop below buyout value either. Once the deal is announced, it's done for the company being purchased. 

I know this sounds obvious to most, but I've seen it happen one to many times. 

The only play in this deal, if you wanted one, is to play Morgan Stanley.

Got annihilated buying calls at the top of MSFT’s last run up. Sold at a hefty loss after the JEDI ruling. Everyone here has gone quiet on MSFT lately. Whenever that happens things seem to take off again after the initial cull. Bought back in today; 3APR $182.5C. Anyone with me?

Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

Putting these out there for good karma and maybe some advice or things I should consider.

Hello it's me, a derivative selling computer algorithm. I sold thousands of deep OTM $SPCE calls 3 months ago. Thanks to a high short interest and low float coupled with media coverage, the underlying has risen enough that my risk management function is yelling at me to hedge. Guess I'll buy $SPCE in bulk at market value every dip.

Hello it's me, a derivative selling computer algorithm. I sold thousands of deep OTM $SPCE calls 3 months ago. Thanks to a high short interest and low float coupled with media coverage, the underlying has risen enough that my risk management function is yelling at me to hedge. Guess I'll buy $SPCE in bulk at market value every dip.

**Magical Crayons TA.**

Yesterday during the session [I suggested getting puts to hedge for today.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f69d94/daily_discussion_thread_february_19_2020/fi3xodp/) I didn't expect as large a drop as we had, which broke the [first support given in yesterday's post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6hd6q/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_20_2020/fi4ueqz/) As [I posted last week when we were wondering if there would be a Friday sell-off,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3guwk/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_14/fhisg20/) breaking of the first support at 335.3 led to selling to 334.7 and a reversal there.

Throughout the day I posted that another small put hedge is a good idea for tomorrow because of the first bit of economic news of the week finally coming up, and G20 this weekend which may cause more risk averse traders to sell off some. We don't have a true bear flag, but if it "completes," the drop is expect to be to 333.2ish, though a small gap to about 332.8 still needs to be filled so it could reach something as low as that. Those ranges represent the next support. If the economic news is good and you're a bull, it is most ideal to exceed the price point of a drop-- around 338.5. To see if we're in another mini-correction we would need to see another "lower high" being set, so exceeding 337.8ish would be the beginnings of a positive sign.

Futures are right on the cusp of breaking our current bullish price channel back into the lower one we had during the coronavirus announcement, so if you're a bull you hope that the pajama traders start buying.

Good luck to all tomorrow and get those tendies.

Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

No doubt in my mind that a huge chunk of this LL move was driven by the post here.  It would've started to move regardless given pre-earnings positioning, but that was like pouring jet fuel onto a small fire.  Options IV just started ramping up as that WSB post got noticed (and now spread everywhere through marketwatch).

Wake up hungover. Watch my MSFT calls burn as I shower. Watch SQ burn up a little bit. Watch this stupid Ally thing rise up. Get to work. Then "work." Add a little more money into RH and spend it on some stupid shit that someone who's about to get banned pumps. maybe hopefully lose only 15% on the day.

Get home. Drink a lot more.

Such a massive amount of cognitive dissonance in this market & on this sub. China GDP for first quarter is about to go from 6.1 to -.2% and Nasdaq keeps mooning. 


Apple report sales in China down up to fucking 60% this quarter, but gets bought up so hard today lmao. 

Hedge funds too pussy to sell, they have been underperforming the S&P for a while. but when it starts to crack, they’re all going to bail. Might not be tomorrow, or even next week, but there is no way stocks are pricing in any sort of risk and tbh it’s fucking retarded. 

Mean reversion will come, like it always has, and it will be much more painful this time. 

Except QQQ to reach at least 226, and will buy puts tomorrow depending on the price action.

**Magical Crayons TA.**

Yesterday during the session [I suggested getting puts to hedge for today.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f69d94/daily_discussion_thread_february_19_2020/fi3xodp/) I didn't expect as large a drop as we had, which broke the [first support given in yesterday's post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6hd6q/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_20_2020/fi4ueqz/) As [I posted last week when we were wondering if there would be a Friday sell-off,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3guwk/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_14/fhisg20/) breaking of the first support at 335.3 led to selling to 334.7 and a reversal there.

Throughout the day I posted that another small put hedge is a good idea for tomorrow because of the first bit of economic news of the week finally coming up, and G20 this weekend which may cause more risk averse traders to sell off some. We don't have a true bear flag, but if it "completes," the drop is expect to be to 333.2ish, though a small gap to about 332.8 still needs to be filled so it could reach something as low as that. Those ranges represent the next support. If the economic news is good and you're a bull, it is most ideal to exceed the price point of a drop-- around 338.5. To see if we're in another mini-correction we would need to see another "lower high" being set, so exceeding 337.8ish would be the beginnings of a positive sign.

Futures are right on the cusp of breaking our current bullish price channel back into the lower one we had during the coronavirus announcement, so if you're a bull you hope that the pajama traders start buying.

Good luck to all tomorrow and get those tendies.

Like usually it will be a news headline and a 1 candle algo move. Like when all the trade talk shit was going on. But a real sell straight down...

Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

Putting these out there for good karma and maybe some advice or things I should consider.

Lmao First Solar (FSLR) is absolutely fucked tomorrrow. EPS of -0.56 compared to estimate of 2.76. They missed sales by $1.4 billion.

1.4 billion dollars. Fucking hell. Puts at open?

Edit: Sales were 1.4 billion on estimate of 1.79 billion. I’m retarded and can’t read. You’re still fucked if you have calls tho.

To do tomorrow:
Watch my $FSLR calls go to .05. 
Wonder why I didn't sell at noon Thursday. Remember that it's because I have a 9-5 that I hate.
Watch everything else turn red and realize I don't have a healthy mix of puts because autism.
Maybe find some money to buy some way otm calls so I have some hope for next week.

2020-02-20 13:47:34.542712between words
ETFC just got bought by Morgan Stanley for $13B. They're up 23% premarket. 

PRO-TIP: DO NOT BUY ETFC!!

I've seen it far too many times that people see companies up big % and they try to jump in and ride the wave or try to short expecting a pull-back. Do not do this here. 

When a company gets purchased, the share price rises to the value of the buyout. It will not go above the buyout value and it will not drop below buyout value either. Once the deal is announced, it's done for the company being purchased. 

I know this sounds obvious to most, but I've seen it happen one to many times. 

The only play in this deal, if you wanted one, is to play Morgan Stanley.

I've seen it far too many times that people see companies up big % and they try to jump in and ride the wave or try to short expecting a pull-back. Do not do this here. 

When a company gets purchased, the share price rises to the value of the buyout. It will not go above the buyout value and it will not drop below buyout value either. Once the deal is announced, it's done for the company being purchased. 

I know this sounds obvious to most, but I've seen it happen one to many times. 

The only play in this deal, if you wanted one, is to play Morgan Stanley.

Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

Putting these out there for good karma and maybe some advice or things I should consider.

EDIT: Anyone else looking at $INTC 70c 3/20??? These are <$1 right now.

this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

Putting these out there for good karma and maybe some advice or things I should consider.

EDIT: Anyone else looking at $INTC 70c 3/20??? These are <$1 right now.

**Magical Crayons TA.**

Yesterday during the session [I suggested getting puts to hedge for today.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f69d94/daily_discussion_thread_february_19_2020/fi3xodp/) I didn't expect as large a drop as we had, which broke the [first support given in yesterday's post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6hd6q/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_20_2020/fi4ueqz/) As [I posted last week when we were wondering if there would be a Friday sell-off,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3guwk/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_14/fhisg20/) breaking of the first support at 335.3 led to selling to 334.7 and a reversal there.

Throughout the day I posted that another small put hedge is a good idea for tomorrow because of the first bit of economic news of the week finally coming up, and G20 this weekend which may cause more risk averse traders to sell off some. We don't have a true bear flag, but if it "completes," the drop is expect to be to 333.2ish, though a small gap to about 332.8 still needs to be filled so it could reach something as low as that. Those ranges represent the next support. If the economic news is good and you're a bull, it is most ideal to exceed the price point of a drop-- around 338.5. To see if we're in another mini-correction we would need to see another "lower high" being set, so exceeding 337.8ish would be the beginnings of a positive sign.

Futures are right on the cusp of breaking our current bullish price channel back into the lower one we had during the coronavirus announcement, so if you're a bull you hope that the pajama traders start buying.

Good luck to all tomorrow and get those tendies.

Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

Putting these out there for good karma and maybe some advice or things I should consider.

My moves tomorrow:

Wake up hungover. Watch my MSFT calls burn as I shower. Watch SQ burn up a little bit. Watch this stupid Ally thing rise up. Get to work. Then "work." Add a little more money into RH and spend it on some stupid shit that someone who's about to get banned pumps. maybe hopefully lose only 15% on the day.

Get home. Drink a lot more.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

My moves tomorrow:

Wake up hungover. Watch my MSFT calls burn as I shower. Watch SQ burn up a little bit. Watch this stupid Ally thing rise up. Get to work. Then "work." Add a little more money into RH and spend it on some stupid shit that someone who's about to get banned pumps. maybe hopefully lose only 15% on the day.

Get home. Drink a lot more.

**Magical Crayons TA.**

Yesterday during the session [I suggested getting puts to hedge for today.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f69d94/daily_discussion_thread_february_19_2020/fi3xodp/) I didn't expect as large a drop as we had, which broke the [first support given in yesterday's post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6hd6q/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_20_2020/fi4ueqz/) As [I posted last week when we were wondering if there would be a Friday sell-off,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3guwk/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_14/fhisg20/) breaking of the first support at 335.3 led to selling to 334.7 and a reversal there.

Throughout the day I posted that another small put hedge is a good idea for tomorrow because of the first bit of economic news of the week finally coming up, and G20 this weekend which may cause more risk averse traders to sell off some. We don't have a true bear flag, but if it "completes," the drop is expect to be to 333.2ish, though a small gap to about 332.8 still needs to be filled so it could reach something as low as that. Those ranges represent the next support. If the economic news is good and you're a bull, it is most ideal to exceed the price point of a drop-- around 338.5. To see if we're in another mini-correction we would need to see another "lower high" being set, so exceeding 337.8ish would be the beginnings of a positive sign.

Futures are right on the cusp of breaking our current bullish price channel back into the lower one we had during the coronavirus announcement, so if you're a bull you hope that the pajama traders start buying.

Good luck to all tomorrow and get those tendies.

Not expecting much for tomorrow so positions are locked until at least next week. Sorry, no meme stocks for me. I played $LL to the top today and then got out right before things started going south. Also normal disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m doing.

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I’m not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we’ll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don’t go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I’m not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss. I walk into Target like once in a blue moon and only out of desperation or the basic goods. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/

Putting these out there for good karma and maybe some advice or things I should consider.

EDIT: Anyone else looking at $INTC 70c 3/20??? These are <$1 right now.

Please join me as we recite The Autist's Prayer.

Our u/1R0NYMAN who art in debt, hallowed be thy name. Thy box spreads come. Thy will be done, on Robinhood as it is in r/wallstreetbets. Give us this day our risk-free money; and forgive us our puts against you, as we forgive those who exercise their options early; and lead us not into r/personalfinance, but deliver us some tendies.

EDIT: Can't take the credit, had this saved from u/DrTendies but felt like the $SPCE rush was a good opportunity to bring it back out.

Got annihilated buying calls at the top of MSFT’s last run up. Sold at a hefty loss after the JEDI ruling. Everyone here has gone quiet on MSFT lately. Whenever that happens things seem to take off again after the initial cull. Bought back in today; 3APR $182.5C. Anyone with me?

2020-02-20 13:51:11.340058between words
ETFC just got bought by Morgan Stanley for $13B. They're up 23% premarket. 

PRO-TIP: DO NOT BUY ETFC!!

I've seen it far too many times that people see companies up big % and they try to jump in and ride the wave or try to short expecting a pull-back. Do not do this here. 

When a company gets purchased, the share price rises to the value of the buyout. It will not go above the buyout value and it will not drop below buyout value either. Once the deal is announced, it's done for the company being purchased. 

I know this sounds obvious to most, but I've seen it happen one to many times. 

The only play in this deal, if you wanted one, is to play Morgan Stanley.

All of the plebs here think that SPY being down -0.3% is tanking... If you need to prefix the number with "0." it ain't tanking.
between words
Let's hope for a morning SPY pump and reversal from this red shit so my spreads that I sold don't screw me over. Wooo! Let's go SPY! All the paydays from yesterday dumping into 401k's might help push us? Orrrr I'm fucked.

Just a heads up, there has been a lot of quality posts about ALLY. 

I was in on RAD yesterday and cashed out today. I think ALLY has a lot more room to run, especially with the CEO presenting next week. They bought a company and tanked, they will see their $33 levels before March.  [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ally-financial-to-present-at-the-credit-suisse-financial-services-forum-301008843.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ally-financial-to-present-at-the-credit-suisse-financial-services-forum-301008843.html)

Just in case you dont know ,  when regular people talk about stocks and how much there 401ks have in them the top is here . there doesnt have to be any more corona virus news to sell off . anyone one with half a brain already knows its the end . most people live pay check to paycheck. You cant have this much disruption without problems . big money is bending over retail investors. The real bad news wont be here for another couple of months . i can tell you when the bottom is . it is when you everyone you know says that there 401ks are worth 7.00 dollars and they are never trusting the stock market again .hedge according to your personal risk tolerance . and be sure to buy the real bottom. And may J pow have mercy on my 409k
